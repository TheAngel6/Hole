                in a hole with no light in a hole with no hope in a hole where life standing on a thin thread is the soul of many who at any moment may snap to collapse and no return may find the lost soul who fights to stay but the hate of wave makes it a pain to stay this is the hole that needs to be ignited not with fire but with the love which is needed
